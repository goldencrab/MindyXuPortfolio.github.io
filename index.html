			<h3>Currently watching: <span style = "color: #b3e0ff">Mr. Robot</span></h3>
			<p><img src = "images/robot.jpg" width = "340" height = "500"></p>
			<p>A psychological thriller with computer hacking. 
			Main character is a hacker called Elliot Alderson, played by Rami Malek,
			who tries to destroy "Evil Corp" by hacking into their computer systems. 
			Every week after school, I watch one episode. Right now, Season 2 is over, so I'm
			looking forward to season 3.

			<h3>Favorite Game: <span style = "color: #b3e0ff">Cytus</span></h3>
			<p><img src = "images/cytus.png" width = "500" height = "300"></p>
			<p>A rhythm tapping game on your smartphone. The name "Cytus" comes from Cocytus,
			a river of wailing. There's a story told in the images for each chapter, each chapter
			containing more songs. In this story, a woman named Vanessa, lives in a 22nd century
			world, where robots with human memories are a thing. She becomes a robot, but a disaster
			occurs and she loses her memories. She doesn't know who she is, so playing these 
			rhythm games are supposed to help revive human emotions. But most of the titles of the 
			songs aren't really related to the plot.</p>
